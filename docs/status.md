If you want to list the absolute most important skills that clearly and accurately define what you accomplished with this project, here is the curated list.

These are the "resume-grade" skills that immediately tell a hiring manager or senior engineer that this was a serious, production-ready project:

1. Backend Engineering & Frameworks
   NestJS (Used as the core Node.js framework for scalable, modular architecture)
   TypeScript (Used for strict typing, DTOs, and robust object-oriented design)
2. Database & Data Consistency
   PostgreSQL (The primary relational database used for strict ACID compliance)
   TypeORM (Used for database migrations, entity modeling, and transactions)
   Optimistic Locking / Concurrency Control (Used specifically to prevent inventory overselling during concurrent checkouts)
3. Architecture & System Design
   Modular Monolith Architecture (Designing the system with strict domain boundaries like Catalog, Orders, and Payments without the premature overhead of Microservices)
   Event-Driven Architecture (Using internal event emitters to decouple complex workflows like payments and notifications)
   Idempotency (Ensuring payment webhooks and checkouts can safely handle duplicate requests or network timeouts)
4. Performance & Observability
   Redis Caching (Used to drastically improve throughput and lower latency on read-heavy endpoints like the product catalog)
   Structured Logging (Using pino to format logs as JSON with Request IDs for production observability)
5. DevOps & CI/CD
   Docker / Docker Compose (Containerizing the application and database for absolute parity between local development and production)
   GitHub Actions (Automating the CI/CD pipeline to enforce linting, unit tests, and integration tests before deployment)
